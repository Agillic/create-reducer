# Agillic Create Reducer

Make your Redux life easier using this helper!
Made with :heart: by Agillic

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @agillic/create-reducer
```

Or if you're using `yarn`

```sh
yarn add @agillic/create-reducer
```

## Usage

Agillic PropTypes are compatible with the standard React ones, so you can just import them and carry on with business as usual.

In order to import all the validators, use:

```javascript
import agillicPropTypes from '@agillic/prop-types'
```

or to import validators separately:

```javascript
import {nameOfValidator} from '@agillic/prop-types'
```

Or for some good old nostalgia:

```javascript
const agillicPropTypes = require('@agillic/prop-types')
